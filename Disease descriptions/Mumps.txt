Mumps is a viral infection that primarily affects saliva-producing (salivary) glands that are located near your ears. 

Mumps can cause swelling in one or both of these glands. 

Mumps was common in the United States until mumps vaccination became routine. 

Since then, the number of cases has dropped dramatically.
