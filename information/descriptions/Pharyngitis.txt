Pharyngitis — commonly known as sore throat — is an inflammation of the pharynx, resulting in a sore throat. Thus, pharyngitis is a symptom, rather than a condition. It is usually caused by viral and/or bacterial infections, such as the common cold and flu (both viral infections) or by infection with the Streptococcus bacterium (strep throat). 
Pharyngitis can also occur with mononucleosis (aka “mono”), a viral infection.
Symptoms:
Sore throat
Dry, scratchy throat
Pain when swallowing
Pain when speaking
Other symptoms may be present, depending on the cause. These include fatigue, malaise, muscle aches, headache and fever — especially with the flu or other viral infections.
