The common cold is a viral infection of your nose and throat (upper respiratory tract). 

It's usually harmless, although it might not feel that way. 

Many types of viruses can cause a common cold. 

Healthy adults can expect to have two or three colds each year. 

Infants and young children may have even more frequent colds.
