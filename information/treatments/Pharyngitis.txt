Diagnosis requires a physical exam and laryngoscopy (scope exam in a clinic) to assess for all the possible causes of pharyngitis.
Treatment:
The treatment depends on the cause. Viral pharyngitis goes away on its own with salt water gargles, pain relievers and extra fluids to help alleviate the symptoms. Bacterial pharyngitis is treated with antibiotics; and fungal pharyngitis, with antifungal medications. Prompt antibiotic therapy is needed for strep throat because untreated, it can sometimes cause kidney problems and rheumatic fever, which can damage the heart valves
