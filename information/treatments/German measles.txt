Although these symptoms may not seem serious, you should contact your doctor if you suspect you have German measles. 

This is especially important if youre pregnant or believe you may be pregnant. 

Since German measles appears similar to other viruses that cause rashes, your doctor will confirm your diagnosis with a blood test.
