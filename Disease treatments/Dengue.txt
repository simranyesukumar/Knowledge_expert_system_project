Prevention:

Vaccine
In areas of the world where dengue fever is common, one dengue fever vaccine (Dengvaxia) is approved for people ages 9 to 45 who have already had dengue fever at least once. The vaccine is given in three doses over the course of 12 months.

The vaccine is approved only for people who have a documented history of dengue fever or who have had a blood test that shows previous infection with one of the dengue viruses â€” called seropositivity. In people who have not had dengue fever in the past (seronegative), receiving the vaccine appears to increase the risk of severe dengue fever and hospitalization due to dengue fever in the future.
Prevent mosquito bites
The World Health Organization stresses that the vaccine is not an effective tool on its own to reduce dengue fever in areas where the illness is common. Preventing mosquito bites and controlling the mosquito population are still the main methods for preventing the spread of dengue fever.

Medication:
Rest as much as possible.
Take acetaminophen (also known as paracetamol outside of the United States) to control fever and relieve pain.
Do not take aspirin or ibuprofen!
Drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated. Drink water or drinks with added electrolytes.
