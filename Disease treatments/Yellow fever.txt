As with other Flavivirus infections, no cure is known for yellow fever. 

Hospitalization is advisable and intensive care may be necessary because of rapid deterioration in some cases. 

Certain acute treatment methods lack efficacy: passive immunization after the emergence of symptoms is probably without effect; ribavirin and other antiviral drugs, as well as treatment with interferons, are ineffective in yellow fever patients.
