An ulcer is a sore on the skin or a mucous membrane, accompanied by the disintegration of tissue. Ulcers can result in complete loss of the epidermis and often portions of the dermis and even subcutaneous fat. 
Ulcers are most common on the skin of the lower extremities and in the gastrointestinal tract.
Prevention:

Eat enough calories and protein to stay healthy.
Drink plenty of water every day. 
Make sure your clothes are not increasing your risk of developing pressure ulcers: Avoid clothes that have thick seams, buttons, or zippers that press on your skin

Treatment:

Treatment for your stomach ulcer will depend on what caused it. With treatment, most ulcers heal in a few months.

If your stomach ulcer is caused by a Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) bacterial infection, a course of antibiotics and a medication called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is recommended.

This is also recommended if it's thought your stomach ulcer is caused by a combination of an H. pylori infection and taking non-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs).

If your stomach ulcer is just caused by taking NSAIDs, a course of PPI medication is recommended.
Medication:
Omeprazole
pantoprazole
lansoprazole
