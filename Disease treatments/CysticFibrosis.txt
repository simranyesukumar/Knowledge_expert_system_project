Prevention:
If you or your partner has close relatives with cystic fibrosis, you both may choose to have genetic testing before having children. The test, which is performed in a lab on a sample of blood, can help determine your risk of having a child with CF.

If you're already pregnant and the genetic test shows that your baby may be at risk of cystic fibrosis, your doctor can conduct additional tests on your developing child.

Genetic testing isn't for everyone. Before you decide to be tested, you should talk to a genetic counselor about the psychological impact the test results might carry.

Treatment:

There's currently no cure for cystic fibrosis, but a number of treatments are available to help control the symptoms, prevent complications, and make the condition easier to live with.

Possible treatments include:

antibiotics to prevent and treat chest infections
medicines to make the mucus in the lungs thinner and easier to cough up
medicines to widen the airways and reduce inflammation
special techniques and devices to help clear mucus from the lungs
medicines that help the person absorb food better
following a special diet and taking supplements to prevent malnutrition
