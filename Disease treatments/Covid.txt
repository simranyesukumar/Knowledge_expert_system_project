Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if indoors.
Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.
Get vaccinated when it’s your turn. Follow local guidance about vaccination.
Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you cough or sneeze.
Stay home if you feel unwell.
